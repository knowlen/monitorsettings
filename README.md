# Monitor Settings

Terminal-based monitor control utility for Linux systems using DDC/CI protocol.

<script src="https://asciinema.org/a/731872.js" id="asciicast-731872" async="true"></script>



## Features

- Real-time brightness control with visual progress bars
- Control all monitors simultaneously or individually
- Keyboard navigation with arrow keys
- Debounced DDC commands for responsive performance
- Two UI modes: inline (blessed) and full-screen (curses)
- Support for multiple monitors
- Extensible architecture for future monitor settings

## System Requirements

- Linux (tested on Arch Linux)
- Python 3.7+
- `ddcutil` - DDC/CI monitor control utility
- Monitors with DDC/CI support enabled

## Installation

### System Dependencies

First, install `ddcutil`:

```bash
# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S ddcutil

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install ddcutil

# Fedora
sudo dnf install ddcutil
```

### Setup DDC/CI Access

1. Load the i2c kernel module:
```bash
sudo modprobe i2c-dev
```

2. Make it persistent across reboots:
```bash
echo 'i2c-dev' | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/i2c-dev.conf
```

3. Add your user to the i2c group:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG i2c $USER
```

4. Log out and back in for group changes to take effect.

### Python Package Installation

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/knowlen/monitorsettings.git
cd monitorsettings

# Install package (with optional blessed dependency)
pip install -e ".[blessed]"

# Or without blessed (curses-only mode)
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

```bash
# Run the monitor settings controller
monitorsettings

# Or use Python module syntax
python -m monitorsettings
```

### Controls

| Key(s) | Action |
|--------|--------|
| ↑/→ | Increase brightness |
| ↓/← | Decrease brightness |
| +/- | Adjust step size |
| 0 | Control all displays |
| 1-9 | Control specific display |
| q/Esc | Quit |

## Monitor Setup

DDC/CI must be enabled in your monitor's OSD menu. Look for settings named:
- DDC/CI
- DDC
- Display Data Channel

## Troubleshooting

### No monitors detected
- Ensure DDC/CI is enabled in monitor OSD
- Check i2c-dev module: `lsmod | grep i2c_dev`
- Verify i2c group membership: `groups | grep i2c`
- Some video cables don't support DDC

### Slow response
DDC/CI protocol limitation. Response times vary by monitor model.

### Permission errors
- Add user to i2c group: `sudo usermod -aG i2c $USER`
- Log out and back in for group changes
- Load i2c-dev module: `sudo modprobe i2c-dev`

## Architecture

- Modular design with pluggable UI backends (blessed/curses)
- Async DDC command processing with debouncing
- Extensible for additional monitor settings (color temperature, contrast, etc.)
- VCP code 0x10 for brightness control

### Communication Stack
